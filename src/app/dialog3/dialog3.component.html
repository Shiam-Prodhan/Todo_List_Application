  <h3>Documentation</h3>
  <p>
    This project is made by Angular Material Components and Bootstrap 5.3. This is basically CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) based
    project. The data are stored in a local json based server. 
  </p>

  <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
    Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end
    tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
    Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web,
    mobile, or the desktop
  </p>

  <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML
    and TypeScript. Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It implements core
    and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import
    into your apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which
    provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect related code
    into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An
    app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and
    typically has many more feature modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can
    choose among and modify according to your program logic and data. Every app
    has at least a root component.
  </p>

  <p>
    Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly
    related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as
    dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark
    their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that
    defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives
    and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it
    for display.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to
    make it available to components through Dependency Injection (DI).
  </p>

  <p>
    An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically.
    Angular provides the Router service to help you define navigation paths
    among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational
    capabilities.
